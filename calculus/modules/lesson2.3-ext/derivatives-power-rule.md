Great! Let's move on to the next lesson: **The Power Rule for Derivatives**.

### Introduction to the Power Rule

The Power Rule is one of the most straightforward and widely used rules in calculus for finding the derivative of functions that are powers of \( x \). It provides a quick way to differentiate polynomials.

#### The Power Rule Formula
If you have a function:
```python
def f(x):
    return x**n  # n is any real number
```
The derivative of this function is given by:
```python
def f_prime(x):
    return n * x**(n-1)
```
In plain English, to find the derivative of \( x \) raised to any power \( n \):
1. Multiply the function by the exponent \( n \).
2. Decrease the exponent by one.

### Example Using Python

Let's see how this works with a practical example. We'll take a function \( f(x) = x^3 \) and find its derivative using the Power Rule.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define the Function:**
    ```python
    def cubic_function(x):
        return x**3
    ```

2. **Find the Derivative Using the Power Rule:**
    According to the Power Rule, the derivative of \( x^3 \) is \( 3x^2 \). Let's implement this in Python:
    ```python
    def cubic_function_derivative(x):
        return 3 * x**2
    ```

3. **Visualize the Function and Its Derivative:**
    We will plot both the original function and its derivative to see how they compare.

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Define the cubic function and its derivative
    def cubic_function(x):
        return x**3

    def cubic_function_derivative(x):
        return 3 * x**2

    # Generate x values
    x_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
    y_values = cubic_function(x_values)
    y_derivative_values = cubic_function_derivative(x_values)

    # Plot the cubic function
    plt.plot(x_values, y_values, label='f(x) = x^3')
    plt.plot(x_values, y_derivative_values, label="f'(x) = 3x^2", linestyle='--')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Function and Its Derivative')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    ```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Function Definition:** We define `cubic_function` for \( x^3 \) and `cubic_function_derivative` for \( 3x^2 \).
- **Plotting:** We generate a range of \( x \) values and compute the corresponding \( y \) values for both the original function and its derivative. We then plot these functions using `matplotlib`.

### Practical Application

The Power Rule is useful in many real-world applications, such as:
- **Physics:** Calculating velocity and acceleration.
- **Economics:** Finding the marginal cost or revenue functions.
- **Engineering:** Analyzing stress and strain in materials.

#### Example: Optimization Problem
Suppose you are optimizing a design where the cost \( C(x) \) depends on a variable \( x \) like the size of a component. If \( C(x) = x^3 \), the derivative \( C'(x) = 3x^2 \) tells you how the cost changes with respect to \( x \). You can use this information to find the minimum or maximum cost.

### Summary

- **Power Rule:** Simplifies finding the derivative of functions in the form of \( x^n \).
- **Formula:** For \( f(x) = x^n \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = n * x^{(n-1)} \).
- **Applications:** Widely used in various fields to analyze and optimize functions.
