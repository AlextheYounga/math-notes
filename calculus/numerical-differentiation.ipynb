    "### Understanding the Value of \\( h = 1e-5 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "The value \\( h = 1e-5 \\) (which is \\( 0.00001 \\)) is a small number used in numerical differentiation to approximate the derivative of a function. This small value is crucial because it represents a tiny change in the input variable, allowing us to approximate the slope of the function at a particular point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance of \\( h \\)\n",
    "1. **Approximation of the Derivative:**\n",
    "    The derivative of a function at a point \\( t \\) is defined mathematically as:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    f'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(t + h) - f(t - h)}{2h}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "    Here, \\( h \\) is supposed to be infinitesimally small. In practical computations, we can't use an infinitely small number, so we use a very small number like \\( h = 1e-5 \\) to get a close approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balancing Accuracy and Computational Stability:**\n",
    "    - **Too Large \\( h \\):** If \\( h \\) is too large, the approximation of the derivative becomes inaccurate because it fails to capture the local behavior of the function.\n",
    "    - **Too Small \\( h \\):** If \\( h \\) is too small, it can lead to numerical instability due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic in computers. This can cause round-off errors to become significant.\n"
