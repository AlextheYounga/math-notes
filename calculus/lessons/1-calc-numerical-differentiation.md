# Part 1.1 Numerical Differentiation
Not at all! That's a great question and understanding this will deepen your comprehension of how derivatives are approximated numerically.

### Understanding the Value of \( h = 1e-5 \)

The value \( h = 1e-5 \) (which is \( 0.00001 \)) is a small number used in numerical differentiation to approximate the derivative of a function. This small value is crucial because it represents a tiny change in the input variable, allowing us to approximate the slope of the function at a particular point.

#### Significance of \( h \)
1. **Approximation of the Derivative:**
    The derivative of a function at a point \( t \) is defined mathematically as:
    \[
    f'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t + h) - f(t - h)}{2h}
    \]
    Here, \( h \) is supposed to be infinitesimally small. In practical computations, we can't use an infinitely small number, so we use a very small number like \( h = 1e-5 \) to get a close approximation.

2. **Balancing Accuracy and Computational Stability:**
    - **Too Large \( h \):** If \( h \) is too large, the approximation of the derivative becomes inaccurate because it fails to capture the local behavior of the function.
    - **Too Small \( h \):** If \( h \) is too small, it can lead to numerical instability due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic in computers. This can cause round-off errors to become significant.

### Example of Numerical Derivative
Let’s see an example to clarify the role of \( h \).

Consider a simple function:
```python
def simple_function(x):
    return x**2
```

The exact derivative of \( x^2 \) is \( 2x \). We can approximate this using our numerical derivative function with \( h = 1e-5 \).

```python
def numerical_derivative(func, x, h=1e-5):
    return (func(x + h) - func(x - h)) / (2 * h)

# Testing at x = 2
x_value = 2
approx_derivative = numerical_derivative(simple_function, x_value)
exact_derivative = 2 * x_value

print(f"Approximate Derivative at x={x_value}: {approx_derivative}")
print(f"Exact Derivative at x={x_value}: {exact_derivative}")
```

Output:
```
Approximate Derivative at x=2: 4.000000000026205
Exact Derivative at x=2: 4
```

As you can see, the approximate derivative is very close to the exact derivative. The small value of \( h \) helps us achieve this accuracy.

### Key Takeaways
- **Small \( h \):** A small value like \( 1e-5 \) is used to closely approximate the derivative without being too small to cause numerical instability.
- **Accuracy:** The choice of \( h \) balances the need for accuracy and computational stability.
- **Numerical Differentiation:** By using a small \( h \), we can effectively approximate derivatives in a way that is practical for computer calculations.

If this makes sense, we can proceed to explore more about derivatives, or we can discuss another aspect of calculus. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
