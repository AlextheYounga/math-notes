Radians are a unit of measure for angles, just like degrees. 
They are based on the radius of a circle and provide a direct way of relating the angle to the arc length it subtends.

One radian is the angle created when the arc length of a segment of a circle is equal to the radius of that circle. 
In other words, if you wrap the radius of a circle around its circumference, the angle subtended at the center by this arc is one radian.

Both radians and degrees are ways to describe angles as proportions of a full circle, making them independent of the actual physical size of  the circle being measured. They are essentially ratios, and can be viewed like percentages of a full circle. 

The size of a radian is determined by the requirement that there are 2 radians in a circle. 
Thus 2 radians equals 360 degrees. This means that 1 radian = 180/ degrees, and 1 degree = /180 radians.

1 Radian is equal to 57.2958... degrees
